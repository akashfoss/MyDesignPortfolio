Under his guidance I worked on this project. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">At first Harshit gave a brief description about his company and also some details regarding how this community works. Then we had a call to discuss about the design. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">During this time I was also doing a course on UI specialization from coursera, and with that knowledge I started designing this project and drew whatever came in my mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Then I tried to implement those things. Before I proceed further I would like to say the most difficult part *Design should be minimal and well structured*. After hearing this I had to change everything I designed and moved to canva. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I knew somewhat about canva but I was not having much experience with it. I started using canva and got 1000+ ideas to design but then going back to the user conditions, I had to make my own design and I started designing on vistaprint.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">After a lot of searches about designing, I moved to vistaprint (but never used their ideas). I created my own design within 1 hour and I was like oh half of the work is done (i.e only the front part), I was not having any plan to design the back part as I thought only front looking cards are always good. But I was wrong, I sent this design to Harshit and he was very happy to see that. But still something was missing there, he said. Then I thought to design the back part of the card and started with the community quotes. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">But then an idea came in mind of adding QR code linked with the community site and I implemented it too. Now this design was looking super cool as per Harshit. And we decided to move further with the same design. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">To be continued &hellip;. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p></body></html>
